## rjs: Modelling in R. Interactivity in JavaScript.
`rjs` is designed to help you utilise JavaScript's visualisation libraries and R's modelling packages to build tailor-made interactive apps. 

(This is the refactored version of [`jsReact`](https://github.com/kcf-jackson/jsReact) and is largely backward-compatible. I will port the `jsReact` tutorial to `rjs` shortly, for now please visit [this](https://kcf-jackson.github.io/jsReact/index.html) for examples and tutorials.)


## Installation
`rjs` is currently not available from CRAN, but you can install the development version from github with:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kcf-jackson/rjs")
```
